# FrontendWeatherApp
Simple weather app 

You will need an api key from darksky.net to reproduce this app.

Create a config.js file and copy this there:

var config = {
  MY_KEY : 'YOUR KEY HERE',
}

Made alongside the tutorial from dev ed on youtube plus a handfull of things i added.


Live version accesiblle at: YOU CAN'T. Seriously it's pretty hard to depploy a single page app to heroku, much harder than an app with a backend and a database... So still working on it
